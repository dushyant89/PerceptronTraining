PerceptronTraining
==================

The user can provide the no. of inputs from the console to the java program to implement function like xor. If the input provided is 4 so the truth table generate will have 2^4-1 rows for the xor function
We start with an initial weight vector of 0,0,0 and then we modify it so that it learns the behavior
If the algorithm does not converge we break out
